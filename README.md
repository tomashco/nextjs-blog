# NextJs starter template

Originally started from [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn), I've added a few components that better suits my developer needs i.e.:

- Typescript;
- Tailwind;
- EsLint;
- Prettier;
- (soon) Jest;

Component folder structure will follow the [Atomic Design Pattern](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/).
